The hiring policy states that candidates from top universities will be given higher preference. While the intention is to ensure quality, this clause may introduce bias against candidates from lesser-known institutions. Additionally, there is limited mention of diversity or inclusivity measures in the recruitment process. The overall tone remains neutral but could benefit from stronger emphasis on fairness and equal opportunity.
